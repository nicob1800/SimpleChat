## SimpleChat Phase 2

**Contributors:** Nicolas Benavides


**Grade:** 100% 

This project extends a Java-based instant messaging application using the **Object Client-Server Framework (OCSF)**. It features a command-driven interface allowing users and administrators to manage connections via specific `#` commands (e.g., `#quit`, `#logoff`, `#stop`). The system implements a mandatory **Login ID** authentication protocol, ensuring all broadcasted messages are identified by the sender's ID. Additionally, it includes enhanced server-side controls through a `ServerConsole` and robust exception handling to manage graceful client-server shutdowns.
